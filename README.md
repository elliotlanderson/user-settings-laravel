# User-Settings-Laravel
Just a brief project I am putting together to brush up on my Laravel *best practices* if you will.  

## Environment Configuration
I am using a sqlite database stored as `app/database/database.sqlite`
**NOTE**: I *may* port this over to Homestead for an easy vagrant file but currently my computer is running out of space
and I am currently waiting for my backup drive to come from Amazon, so I am going
to do this unless it becomes a hassle.

## Features 
Just a description of some of the features I am implementing to ~~show off~~, I mean
add some cool stuff to the base project.   

- User profile picture uploading and storing in Filesystem, then linking through Database
- 

## Run Application
Just do the ol' `php artisan serve` and you should be good to go on port 8000!
